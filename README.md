# K-Fold-Neural-Network-function
A general function that uses K-Fold validation for Neural Network modelling for either classification or regression problem. The function is also demonstrated with the Red Wine and Abalone dataset.

The Red Wine dataset was used to demonstrate classification using this function while the Abalone datset was used to show the regression. 

This function showcases EarlyStopping, BatchNormalization, and Activity Regularizers function in neural network training.

For classification, scoring was done using the accuracy metric while for regression, the scoring was done using RMSE.
